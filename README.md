# Candy Rush (demo)

Open [index.html](index.html) in a browser to play a small Candy Crush–style demo.

- Drag a candy onto an adjacent candy to swap.
- Match 3 or more in a row/column to clear and score points.
- Click the Restart button to shuffle/reset the board.

This is a simple single-file demo (HTML/CSS/JS) intended to run statically—no build steps required.
